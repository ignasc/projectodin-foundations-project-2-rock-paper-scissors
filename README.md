### Main challenges

The main challenge, oddly, was to avoid rushing through everything too fast and in the beginning I did exactly that. Then I had to backtrack and refactor the code to make it follow assignment steps. The project itself was fairly simple when it comes to solving the problem with code.

### Final thoughts

A very basic game with quite a bit of room left to make it more user friendly with interface.

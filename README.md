### Main challenges

The main challenge, oddly, was to avoid rushing through everything too fast and in the beginning I did exactly that. Then I had to backtrack and refactor the code to make it follow assignment steps. The project itself was fairly simple when it comes to solving the problem with code.

Second return to the project after progressing further into foundation course. Since first iteration, I wrote the game messags in console log and tried to keep every function as simple as possible and the only challenge was to add additional logic and conditions to be able to restart and reset the game progress.

### Final thoughts

A very basic game with quite a bit of room left to make it more user friendly with interface. For now, the basic interface will do the trick!
